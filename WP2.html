					<p>The WP2 is focused on the development of a next generation of VR/AR systems for supporting personnel working in dangerous areas. The main features required are then reliability, flexibility, portability, and speed, features which are not found all together in the current state of the art systems.</p>
					<a href="#" data-title="Figure 1: WRM building block" class="title ribbon"><img src="research/WP2-fig1.png" alt=""></img></a>
					<p>To reach this ambitious task the system will be developed <b>Pivoting</b> on a new hardware concept: the <b>WRM</b> (weighting resistive matrix) developed by <b>Roma2</b> (Figure 1).</p>

						<p>An efficient camera pose tracking system based on the exploitation of the <b>WRM</b> for pattern recognition is being developed jointly by <b>Roma2</b> and <b>EPFL</b> which has a very well established recognition in this field (Figure 3). Both parties will employ <b>2 ER</b> and <b>2ESR</b> (already hired) in key position for this development. The challenge is to submit the state of the art in the pattern recognition techniques to a deep revision to merge them with the features offered by the <b>WRM</b>.</p><p> A crucial part of the system is the I/O and Wi-Fi communication infrastructure which will ensure the portability of the system. Strong requirements are about the necessity for a large and guaranteed bandwidth to permit real time A/V communication between operator and supervisor and to support a lag-less augmented reality experience. <b>NOCA</b> as responsible of this task will be supported by one <b>ESR</b> position.</p>
						<p>At the end of this chain the information stream will be used by the central system, managed by <b>CERN</b> for the generation of the augmented reality content in terms of animations, explanations and artificial highlighting of the relevant elements directly on the see through device. The process logic flow is illustrated in figure 4.</p>
