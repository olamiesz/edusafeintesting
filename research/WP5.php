<h2>Work Package 5: Technology assessment and Exploitation</h2>
<p>WP5 studies how a technology prototype, in this case prepared for the CERN extreme environment, can be transferred to other industry sectors and how to develop and introduce a planning tech-development strategy, which incorporates possible technology transfer potential from the start. </p>
<p>This requires a comprehensive understanding of the research that is being carried out and its adaptation potential, and an in-depth study of different extreme environments requirements and markets. Specific outcomes of this work include among others:</p>
<ul>
<li>A market study, technical assessment and initial business plan</li>
<li>Various training activities on business planning, exploitation and development of an entrepreneurial mindset</li>
<li>Business validation and technological assessment of the final prototype and reverse engineering potential</li>
<li>Market feedback on the EDUSAFE prototype and demonstration</li>
<li>Complete business plan, financial plan and IPR protection plan for the technologies, services and solutions to be developed</li>
</ul>
