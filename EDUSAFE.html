				EDUSAFE is a 4-year Marie Curie ITN project that provides training
				for 10 Early Stage Researchers and 2 Experienced Researchers. The
				project focuses on research into the use of Virtual Reality (VR) and
				Augmented Reality (AR) during planned and emergency maintenance in
				extreme environments (nuclear installations, space, deep sea etc).
				<br><br>The scientific objective of EDUSAFE is research into advanced VR
				and AR technologies for a personnel safety system platform, including
				features, methods and tools. Current technology is not acceptable
				because of significant time-lag in communication and data
				transmission, missing multi-input interfaces, and simultaneous
				supervision of multiple workers who are working in the extreme
				environment. The aim is to technically advance and combine several
				technologies and integrate them as integral part of a personnel
				safety system to improve safety, maintain availability, reduce errors
				and decrease the time needed for scheduled or sudden interventions.
				<br><br>The research challenges lie in the development of real-time
				(time-lags less than human interaction speed) data-transmission,
				instantaneous analysis of data coming from different inputs (vision,
				sound, touch, buttons), interaction with multiple on-site users,
				complex interfaces, portability and wearability, wear/tear. The
				result will be an integrated wearable VR/AR system (+control system)
				which can be implemented and tested as a prototype.
				<br><br>The LHC at CERN and its existing Personnel Safety System,
				requirements and protocols will be used as a test and demonstration
				platform. The project will deliver a comprehensive local and
				network-wide training programme including several secondments for
				each fellow, combined with dissemination and outreach activities. The
				Fellows will gain valuable scientific skills and highly valued soft
				skills from expert and experienced organizations, which will be
				extremely beneficial for their career development both in academia
				and in industry.<br><br>EDUSAFE brings together expertize from 9 partners and 3 associated
				partners from around Europe.</p>
