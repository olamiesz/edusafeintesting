			<h3>Work Package 5: Technology assessment and Exploitation</h3>
			<br>
		</div>
		<div class="RES5text">
			<p>WP5 studies how a technology prototype, in this case prepared for the CERN extreme environment, can be transferred to other industry sectors and how to develop and introduce a planning tech-development strategy, which incorporates possible technology transfer potential from the start. </p>
			<p>This requires a comprehensive understanding of the research that is being carried out and its adaptation potential, and an in-depth study of different extreme environments requirements and markets. Specific outcomes of this work include among others:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A market study, technical assessment and initial business plan</li>
				<li>Various training activities on business planning, exploitation and development of an entrepreneurial mindset</li>
				<li>Business validation and technological assessment of the final prototype and reverse engineering potential</li>
				<li>Market feedback on the EDUSAFE prototype and demonstration</li>
				<li>Complete business plan, financial plan and IPR protection plan for the technologies, services and solutions to be developed</li>
